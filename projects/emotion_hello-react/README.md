Emotion : Hello React

> since that we are already using the HTML inside of the JS through the `.jsx`, the next step would be also use the CSS-in-JS, the main advantage of it is to have more code flexibility to define the styles to the application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). `yarn create react-app emotion_hello-react`

> `yarn add classnames emotion react-emotion emotion-theming`

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
